# DDP_iLQR_Variants

Library serves as a codespace for all my code for the master thesis: **Efficient Ineqaulity Constrained Model Predictive Control on Matrix Lie Group**.

Several sub-goals for the procedure:
- iLQR for 1d system in Euclidean space
- iLQR for nd system in Euclidean space
- DDP for 1d system in Euclidean space
- DDP for nd system in Euclidean space
- iLQR for system on Matrix Lie group
- DDP for system on Matrix Lie group
